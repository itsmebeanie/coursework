range.js: Implement a function called range that works like 
Python's range method. I.e. the number of arguments that 
it receives determines how it works. range will produce an 
Array of Numbers based on the arguments passed in 


linkedList.js: Write a function arrayToList that builds up a data structure
and write a listToArray function that produces an array from a list. 
Also write the helper functions prepend, which takes an element and a
list and creates a new list that adds the element to the front of the 
input list, and nth, which takes a list and a number and returns the 
element at the given position in the list, or undefined when there is no 
such element.


blackjack.js: This program is a commandline Blackjack game with 2 players - the user and the computer.
- each player is dealt 2 cards from a 52 card deck, with each card representing 
some numeric value
- each player can choose to be dealt more cards ("hit") or stop being dealt cards 
("stand")
- the sum of the numeric values of the cards in a player's hand determines if they've 
won
- once both players have either chosen to stand or have a hand with a total that's 
more than 21 ("bust"), the hands are compared
- the player with the hand that's closest to 21 without going over wins
ties are possible (either same total, or both player "bust")
